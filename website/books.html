    <h1>What's On My Bookshelf?</h1>
    <p>A website dedicated to sharing some really good books.</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Michaela Burton and I am a senior at the University of Pittsburgh.
    I am majoring in Media and Professional Communications on a digital media track.
    I am also on the gymnastics team here. Juggling class on top of practice and homework
    can be really stressful, but having good time management skills is important to stay
    on top of everything I have to do.</p>
    <p>When I get a chance during my busy schedule, I love to spend my freetime reading.
    Now that I'm learning how to make a website in my <em><strong>composing digital media</em></strong> class,
    I thought this was the perfect time to share some good books I have come across!</p>
