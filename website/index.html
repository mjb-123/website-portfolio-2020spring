      <p>A website dedicated to help everyone become a bookworm. Despite what people
      say, I believe that everyone can read and actually enjoy it. Some people
    enjoy non-fiction, some people only enjoy science-fiction and that's OK. Whatever
    best fits your personality and your interest, I'm sure you can find your perfect match here.</p>
    <p>So, for those of you who came here for suggestions, I hope you walk away with
      one your are excited to try. Those of you who came here to figure out where to start,
      I hope you enjoy whatever book you choose.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p style="margin: 15px; border:1px solid black;">
      <p>Hello! My name is Michaela Burton and I am a senior at the University of Pittsburgh.
      I am majoring in Media and Professional Communications on a digital media track.
      Reading is not something I have always been passionate about, but I remember exactly when
      my view on them changed. When I was in 8th grade, a pretty popular book called
      The Hunger Games was getting turned into a movie. One of my friends told me the plot
      of it and I decided to give it a chance. I <em>LOVED</em> it. Once I realized what
      kinds of books I liked to read, I found myself reading more and more. I think that
      everyone is a reader, some people just don't know what they would like to read.
      I hope this website helps you figure out what genre best suits you!

      <p>Also a little fun fact about me is that I was on the gymnastics team here at Pitt.
        Juggling class on top of practice and homework can be really stressful, but having good
        time management skills is important to stay on top of everything I have to do.
        When I get a chance during my busy schedule, I love to spend my freetime reading.
        Now that I'm learning how to make a website in my <em><strong>composing digital media</em></strong>
        class, I thought this was the perfect time to share some good books I have come across!</p>
