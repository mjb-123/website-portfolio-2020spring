    <h1>Mystery</h1>
    <p>This genre includes books that are usually about murder or crimes that need
      to be solved. With so many possible suspects or ones you never considered suspects,
      mystery novels are known for their huge plot twists.
  If you enjoy books that have a completely unexpected ending, this is a great genre to get into.</p>
