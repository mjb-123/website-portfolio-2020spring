    <h1>Romance</h1>
    <p>This genre includes books in which 2 or more characters relationship is the main focuse
      while other things like mystery or adventure is secondary. You are invested
      in their status and if they will work out or not. Everything else that happens
      to them is either preventing them from being together or helping them develop more.
      If you enjoy books with a love story, this is a great genre to get into.</p>
